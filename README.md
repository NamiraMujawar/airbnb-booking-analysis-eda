# airbnb-booking-analysis-eda

The project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb bookings data, aimed at gaining insights into the patterns and trends of the Airbnb market. The dataset includes information about Airbnb bookings in a particular location, such as the listing description, the booking date, room type,review, and the price.

The project will begin by cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling any missing or incorrect values, and transforming the data into a usable format for analysis. The next step will be to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data, using descriptive statistics, visualization tools, and statistical techniques to identify patterns and trends in the data.

The analysis will focus on answering questions such as:

What is the distribution of Airbnb listings by location, price, and availability?
What factors influence the price of Airbnb listings?
What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb bookings?
What are the most popular neighborhoods for Airbnb bookings?
The project will conclude by summarizing the findings and providing insights that can be used to optimize Airbnb bookings, improve customer experience, and increase profitability for Airbnb hosts.
