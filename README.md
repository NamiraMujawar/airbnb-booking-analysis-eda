# Problem Statement 
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on travelling possibilities and present a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data data that can be analysed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers and providers' (hosts) behaviour and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services and much more. This dataset has around 49,000 observations in it with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values. Explore and analyse the data to discover key understandings.

The project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb bookings data, aimed at gaining insights into the patterns and trends of the Airbnb market. The dataset includes information about Airbnb bookings in a particular location, such as the listing description, the booking date, room type,review, and the price.

The project will begin by cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling any missing or incorrect values, and transforming the data into a usable format for analysis. The next step will be to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data, using descriptive statistics, visualization tools, and statistical techniques to identify patterns and trends in the data.

The analysis will focus on answering questions such as:

What is the distribution of Airbnb listings by location, price, and availability?
What factors influence the price of Airbnb listings?
What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb bookings?
What are the most popular neighborhoods for Airbnb bookings?
The project will conclude by summarizing the findings and providing insights that can be used to optimize Airbnb bookings, improve customer experience, and increase profitability for Airbnb hosts.
