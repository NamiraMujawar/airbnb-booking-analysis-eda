# Problem Statement 
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (host's) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementing innovative additional services, and much more. This dataset has around 49,000 observations with 16 columns and is a mix of categorical and numeric values. Explore and analyze the data to discover key understandings.


# Business Objective
* Understanding the market demand: The analysis can help to understand the demand for Airbnb bookings in a particular location and identify the popular times for booking. This information can be used to optimize the pricing strategy, plan marketing campaigns, and adjust supply accordingly.

* Optimizing the pricing strategy: The analysis can help to identify the factors that affect the price of Airbnb listings, such as location, amenities, and availability. This information can be used to optimize the pricing strategy, set competitive prices, and improve the profitability of the Airbnb business.

* Improving customer experience: The analysis can help to identify the common amenities and features that customers are looking for in Airbnb listings. This information can be used to improve the customer experience, add new features to the listings, and increase customer satisfaction.

* Identifying new business opportunities: The analysis can help to identify new business opportunities in the Airbnb market, such as identifying under-served areas or niches. This information can be used to develop new products or services that cater to these segments and increase the market share.

The project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Airbnb bookings data, aimed at gaining insights into the patterns and trends of the Airbnb market. The dataset includes information about Airbnb bookings in a particular location, such as the listing description, the booking date, room type,review, and the price.

The project will begin by cleaning and preprocessing the data, handling any missing or incorrect values, and transforming the data into a usable format for analysis. The next step will be to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the data, using descriptive statistics, visualization tools, and statistical techniques to identify patterns and trends in the data.

The analysis will focus on answering questions such as:

What is the distribution of Airbnb listings by location, price, and availability?
What factors influence the price of Airbnb listings?
What is the seasonal pattern of Airbnb bookings?
What are the most popular neighborhoods for Airbnb bookings?
The project will conclude by summarizing the findings and providing insights that can be used to optimize Airbnb bookings, improve customer experience, and increase profitability for Airbnb hosts.
